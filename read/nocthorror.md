# NoctHorror 2025!

This weekend, my partner and I wrapped up the sixth annual _NoctHorror_ (formerly _OctHorror_, renamed because it kept creeping further and further into November), our annual Spooky Season film festival we do for our friends. Normally, we watch 13 films over Zoom and wrap the month with a pub quiz about those films, but this year I went a little overboard and made the _films themselves_ into the puzzle. I kept all 13 films a secret until 24 hours before each screening, and sent the players puzzles along the way so they could try and suss them out, as well as an overarching mystery. There's a lot of internal lore that's built up over the last six years, so sharing all of the clues won't make a ton of sense, but check out this tube map I made for one of them:

The symbols on the left are part of the "ancient language Dra-Q-Lese" spoken by long-time antagonist "Count Dra-Q-La", and the map points the players both towards the next three films in the series and hints at the broader theme of the month, which culminated in drawing a giant pentagram on a map to triangulate the Count's hideout. I was even extra-devious this year and made some of the stops clickable in the PDF, so savvy players could uncover hidden mini-quizzes that netted them extra points in the finale. I'm extremely proud of it, but _woof_ am I tired. 😅 Part of this year's event was a symbolic "passing the torch", and I'm excited for someone else to take the reins next year, at least when it comes to picking the films.

This year, we watched:

<ol>
<li>A Quiet Place</li>
<li>Bodies Bodies Bodies</li>
<li>Poseidon</li>
<li>247℉</li>
<li>Let It Snow (2020)</li>
<li>Saloum</li>
<li>Anaconda</li>
<li>Bacurau</li>
<li>In the Shadows in the Mountains</li>
<li>The Edge of the Shadows</li>
<li>The Platform</li>
<li>Omen</li>
<li>Congo</li>
</ol>

And before you even start — I _know_ that some of those aren't horror films. I was going for a whole geographical theme, it all made sense in the end.

Of the selection this year, I liked _Saloum_ and _Bacurau_ the best (RIP Udo Kier), and despite _Omen_ being a straight-up drama (despite what the trailer and marketing sell it as), I recommend that to pretty much anybody. _In the Shadows in the Mountains_ and _The Edge of the Shadows_ aren't good movies by any means (sorry, Malik), but it was so cool to see a Greenland local's take on their folklore.

Because we started this tradition deep in the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our screenings were over Zoom, which is a legally dark-gray area, but **hypothetically** one way to facilitate this sort of thing is:

<ul>
<li>Buy as many of the films as possible on DVD</li>
<li>Hook your DVD player into an HDMI switcher (so you can swap between it and your Nintendo Switch and your Apple TV)</li>
<li>Make sure your 
<li>Plug the output of the switcher into an HDMI splitter</li>
<li>Take one of the outputs from the splitter and plug it into your TV</li>
<li>Take the other end of the splitter and plug it into an HDMI-to-Analog converter (for example a _Mini HDMI2AV Upscaler 1080p_, hypothetically)</li>
<li>Take an RCA cable from the output of the converter into an Analog to USB Video Capture Device (there are a hundred generic versions of these)</li>
<li>Optionally, use a USB to USB-C converter to plug that into your laptop</li>
<li>Use [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com) to take in the audio and video from the caputure device, making sure to add any necessary filters to account for "buzz" that might happen during the analog conversion</li>
<li>Start the OBS virtual camera</li>
<li>Open Zoom or your video communication app of choice</li>
<li>Set your camera and microphone to the OBS virtual camera (and make sure to enable any "high-quality audio for musicians" settings)</li>
</ul>

And _voila_! Hypothetically, you'll be watching your favorite films with your friends, as though you were all in the same room together. The digital-to-analog conversion helps make sure DRM won't stop you, and gives everything an actually pretty pleasant late-VHS/early-DVD vibe.

In case you're looking for any further inspiration (or if you're me next year, trying to remember this), here's what we watched for previous NoctHorrors:

## 2024

This year we had a "teen horror" theme, with everyone picking cabins in the fictional "Camp Dra-Q-La" and competing for prizes throughout the month. We watched:

<ol>
<li>Jennifer's Body</li>
<li>Ginger Snaps</li>
<li>I Know What You Did Last Summer</li>

<li>Sleepaway Camp</li>
<li>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</li>
</ol>

## 2023

This was our first themed year where we voted for "space", so naturally I included a fully-voiced HAL 9000 to "help" me run the quiz (I did, somehow, shove him out an airlock in the end).

<ol>
<li>The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)</li>
<li>Killer Klowns from Outer Space</li>
<li>Plan 9 from Outer Space</li>
<li>The Thing</li>

<li>Sunshine</li>
<li>Predator</li>
<li>Alien</li>
</ol>

## 2022

This was before we were officially doing themes, but even then I was always playing with the idea of how each film could relate to the next one, so the whole thing had kind of a semi-logical flow to it.

<ol>
<li>Dracula</li>
<li>The Wolf Man</li>
<li>Monster House</li>
<li>The Cabin in the Woods</li>
<li>The Evil Dead</li>
<li>Drag Me To Hell</li>

<li>Old</li>
<li>Us</li>
<li>Parasite</li>
<li>Pet Sematary (2019)</li>
<li>Shaun of the Dead</li>
</ol>

## 2021

This was when we landed on doing 13 films for the event, which gave us a good (spooky) number and meant we could schedule it in a way that fit for more of our friends' schedules. As always, the real monster is "having other responsibilities"!

<ol>
<li>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</li>
<li>Psycho</li>
<li>The Birds</li>
<li>Rosemary's Baby</li>
<li>Don't Look Now</li>

<li>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</li>
<li>It Follows</li>
<li>One Cut of the Dead</li>
</ol>

## 2020

We started this right in the middle of a lockdown, half out of our minds anyway, and just needed to do _something_. So we thought it would be a good idea to watch one movie every night for the entire month of October. And it was a good idea at the time! Just... not one I'd do again.

<ol>
