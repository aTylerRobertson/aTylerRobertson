# Need the big screen for the little posts

Just thinking about what kind of blogging I want to do this year, and I think it's two things: I want to blog less seriously, but do it on the laptop instead of my phone. Originaly I came up with this whole system by which I could write on my phone and post from wherever, but in practice I think that made everything feel weirdly more and less formal than I want it. So... fuck that.

I remember reading somewhere (probably Instagram) that Millennials need big screens for big purchases, and won't buy flights or things like that on their phones, and while that is cringe in a uniquely Millennial way (the last generation capable of shame) I think I'm OK with that being true for writing.

Other than that, 2026 is off to a good start! I've got a tiny little diary (physical paper!) to help keep track of what I do each day, because 2025 felt like a blur, and I've done a nice little refresh on all my electronic devices to get a fresh-ish start to the year. Next week I should be getting some parts to do a final repair on my old GameBoy Color so it can be my commuting buddy again, and then I should be all set up to have a low-stress re-entry into the daily grind.

Toodles!
