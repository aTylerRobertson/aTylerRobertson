                <h1>
                    Art seems difficult because you've been lied to about what
                    art is
                </h1>

                <p>
                    In Frank Herbert's <i>Dune</i>, Kylie Jenner's boyfriend
                    <i>the Kwisatz Haderach</i> points out that "whoever can
                    destroy a thing, controls the thing." And in fact in the
                    book's later stages (there's a movie version don't worry),
                    Herbert's protagonist pulls a reverse-Christ and turns the
                    spice melange (the galaxy's superdrug and seemingly only
                    intoxicant) into water through the power of generational
                    mommy issues and phallic imagery, thus demonstrating his
                    power over the spice <i>by</i> destroying it. Sort of a
                    trick you can only pull once, but OK. Maybe there's a
                    <i>Connecticut Yankee</i> angle I missed in the sequels...
                    <i>Anyway,</i>
                </p>

                <p>
                    AI! Not just a buzzword to get you past the first paragraph,
                    but in fact a Chalamet Haderach of our very own — a
                    messianic figure for the 21st century, brought about by the
                    power of generational mommy issues and phallic imagery. Some
                    of us have seen it firsthand; its Voice is miraculous, its
                    Works a marvel. All for a low, low price. Oh, did I mention
                    the price? Never fear: AI embraces tradition with the return
                    of
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indulgence"
                        >Indulgences</a
                    >, invisible tokens to be purchased with Real American
                    Dollars (TM) and converted directly into answered prayers.
                    So load up, lock in, and feel your need for things slide
                    away, into the murky depths of the beforetime. Have a
                    question? You've got an answer. Writing an email? Already
                    sent. Oh,
                    <i>you need <b>Art?</b> Movies? Video games?</i> No sweat,
                    fam. Feed me those sweet tokens, watch me gulp 'em down, and

                </p>

                <i>Come on, Seymour, don't be a putz.</i>

                <p>
                    My intense, <i>painful</i> crush on Hedy Lamarr
                    notwithstanding (god-<i>damn!</i>), the instant satisfaction
                    of an AI "anything app" is the ultimate siren call of
                    capitalism. Its proponents, the sailors who swung hard into
                    the shoals of ChatGPT and Claude and Copilot, return to dry
                    land with tales of gaining new abilities without need for
                    practice or training. A fleet of self-proclaimed artists,
                    musicians, writers, and thinkers coming home to bewildered
                    families, who are mostly "just happy he found something he
                    enjoys."
                </p>

                <p>
                    And a lot of them, truly, do enjoy it. They talk endlessly
                    about the things they can do that were previously kept from
                    them, like how they never used to draw because it was too
                    difficult, or write because it took too long. These tools
                    they've found present a world in which they can simply jump
                    to the result they dreamt about, without the roadblocks of
                    study or critique. So many who had been held back by an
                    unkind word in their childhood are rediscovering a love of
                    artistic creation. And not just creation, but creation of
                    something that looks professional! In some cases they're
                    even getting jobs with it, <i>becoming</i> professionals
                    themselves! Say what you will about the average,
                    middle-class white men and their terrible moustaches (you
                    know they are), but there <b>is</b> something about this
                    turn at the Artificial Intelligence genre that presents a
                    marked difference. Like when Sleep Token released their
                    third studio album <i>Take Me Back To Eden</i> in 2023 — it
                    wasn't the first time that a couple guys put on masks and
                    played prog metal with pop and R&B influences, but people
                    were really starting to take notice.
                </p>

                    >Fuck! I keep getting distracted by pictures of Hedy Lamarr
                    — shit!</i

                <p>
                    Here's the thing about those guys, the AI guys: no matter
                    their intentions, their altruistic goals, their "ethical
                    usage" of the water-chugging leviathan of machinery powering
                    their new passion, <b>they have to pay to play.</b> Now that
                    they're locked into a system that grants them their wildest
                    desires, missing a payment or running out of tokens would
                    cut Samson's hair, and maybe... worse? As someone who's
                    avoided getting deep into AI tools I can't properly imagine
                    this, but there must be some kind of phantom limb feeling of
                    not having AI access, after getting used to it for a year or
                    more. That feeling like... you can <i>picture</i> what you
                    want, but you can't make it happen. Like a hand you forgot
                    was amputated until you reach for your favorite mug.
                </p>

                <p>
                    There's some of you reading this now — I have an undying
                    reply-guy voice in the back of my head — reading this and
                    thinking, <i>"Oh come on, it's not that serious."</i> But I
                    don't think it's fair to brush aside people who feel like
                    they've come to rely on something in order to live a
                    fulfilling life. It's easy to brush it aside as a phase or a
                    misguided attempt at finding purpose, but at some point we
                    have to start taking people seriously when they tell us that
                    they've found something to believe in.
                    <i>Especially</i> when that something comes with a monthly
                    bill. Because, while yes that does mean they could miss a
                    payment, it also means that the company which takes those
                    monthly payments can decide (or get decided at) to close the
                    tap. Forcefully removing artistic creation
                    <i>ex nihilo</i> and replacing it <i>in nihilum</i> with a
                    difficult to describe, but noticeable void.
                </p>

                <b>They can destroy the thing.</b>

                <p>
                    Now, looping back around, we understand that this means they
                    also <i>control</i> the thing. And the "thing" in this case
                    is what their users understand to be art and its many forms
                    — your drawings, paintings, writings, songs, movies, so on,
                    so forths. They control the <i>end product</i> of these arts
                    for their users, as that is all they produce. You cannot ask
                    an AI to help you experience four years of theatre school,
                    for example, but it can write a three-act play about your
                    father as though you did. For the people I've heard from and
                    spoken to about AI, they <i>know</i> that the artforms
                    they're pursuing with Claude or Suno are often exercised by
                    people who have spent <i>years</i> on training and practice
                    and repeated failure — all things they, the geniuses, can
                    circumvent with their new tools. They — maybe even you —
                    believe that the end product is the art.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I'm hopeful that my tone here is clear enough that you can
                    hear that this belief is an incorrect and dangerous one. But
                    I also want to make clear that if you believe this, or know
                    anyone who does, <i>it is not your fault.</i> When we
                    celebrate great artists, when we go to the cinema to watch
                    great works, when we stream <i>Dune 2</i> on our big-screen
                    TVs, we do it because the end product of the art is so
                    breathtaking. We see the final edits and we are astounded by
                    their beauty. We are told by our friends, our family, our
                    newspapers and social feeds, "Wow — now <i>that's</i> art."
                </p>

                <p>
                    My friend, I have excellent news for you: that is not art.
                    What you see on the silver screen or hear in your Bose QC2s
                    is <i>content</i>. And there's an important difference.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Content, by its nature, can be bought and sold. That's how
                    you're seeing it! Someone bought it, and believes they can
                    make a profit by showing it to you. Sometimes that looks
                    like Netflix temporarily leasing the rights for a film, and
                    serving it to you in exchange for a monthly fee. Sometimes
                    that looks like Instagram "allowing" you to post a video of
                    your dog, in exchange for all of your friends watching a
                    5-second ad right after liking it. I mean, fuck, I'm sure
                    someone's profiting off of you reading this exact blog post,
                    but it sure as shit ain't me. AI models are trained on this
                    stuff that's bought and sold, so they produce things that
                    can (if we ignore ethics for a second) be bought and sold in
                    turn. The people who have grasped AI tools the tightest seem
                    to do so because when they tried to make art previously (if
                    they tried at all), they failed to make <i>content</i>. They
                    failed to make something commercially viable, something
                    which was not bought and sold, which did not receive
                    critical acclaim, which will not be written about in the
                    history books, and they confused that for
                    <i>failing at art</i>.
                </p>

                <b>You cannot fail at art.</b> Because — again, this is
                incredible news — art <i>is</i> failing. Failing <i>is</i> art.
                You're already great at it.

                <p>
                    I hate to be a "the dictionary defines 'art' as" person, but
                    truly if you look up any definition of the word, you'll
                    always see the words "activity" and "work".
                    <i>Action</i> and <i>process</i> are intertwined with
                    artistic creation. My other favorite word to use here is
                    <i>"pursuit"</i>, because sometimes you have to chase your
                    art, and sometimes you never catch it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    "Wait," I can hear you typing in the replies again, "what do
                    you mean 'you never catch it'? How is not making art an
                    acceptable end point of <i>making art</i>?"
                </p>

                <p>
                    This is another confusion between art and content, and one
                    that I struggle with all the fucking time (it's why I don't
                    post much anymore, for example). The words "work" and
                    "activity" and "process" and "pursuit" are so often used in
                    the definition of "art" because <i>those are the art</i>.
                    Art is not always meant to produce a spectacle — sometimes
                    it does and that's OK — but it <b>always</b> evokes a
                    change, and that change is the point. That change happens
                    whether you like what you made or not, whether other people
                    like it or not, no matter what materials you used or how
                    much time you spent on it.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I... this is getting a little woo-woo, I feel like I need an
                    example to ground us. Is that OK? I think we should make an
                    art together.

                <i>Did you change something in the world?</i> Well, yeah, you

                feel significant right now, but people will see it (at least I
                will), and that's fucking awesome!

                <i>Did you change something in yourself or others?</i> This is a
                harder question to answer, but think about the change you made.
                Did you like it? Did it make you laugh, or think? Will it make
                someone else laugh or think? Even a tiny bit? Probably!
                Remember, even thinking, "Oh I didn't like that at all, I wish
                I'd done something different" is a change!

                <p>
                    If you answered "yes" to one or both of those questions,
                    you've successfully done art! You are an artist! Now... do
                    it again!
                </p>

                <p>
                    To keep being an artist, to keep succeeding at art, you
                    <b>must</b> drop the notion that art is something that is
                    only valid when it's finished. Arguably, art is the
                    <i>least</i> valid when it's finished – it <i>is</i> the
                    process, the try-it-and-see, the experimentation. When you
                    engage in it, you may not be able to sell whatever you made,
                    but <i>you</i> grow every time. You learn what you like and
                    don't like. You learn what your friends like and don't like.
                    That learning lends purpose to the next thing you try, and
                    the next, and it's the <i>trying</i> that makes us human.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And if your friends never like the art you make that way,
                    guess what? They're telling you that they would rather pay
                    some company for a quick hit of content than be
                    <i>absolutely fucking stoked</i> for their friend engaging
                    in the art of being human. What kind of friend does that
                    sound like?
                </p>

                <p>
                    So... I don't know, this has gone places, I should wrap it
                    up. When I talk to you about why I won't willingly use AI
                    tools, and why I'm concerned about what AI's doing to us as
                    people, please know that that's why: you are already an
                    artist. You're doing fucking great. All AI does when it
                    comes to art is try to convince you that art is something
                    it's not, so they can make you reliant on them, and take
                    your money. It's not complicated.
                </p>

                <p>
                    If you're worried about what you can accomplish without AI
                    tools, do yourself a favor and watch
                    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl4mufYW1Yo"
                        >at least the first ten minutes</a
                    >
                    of <i>Fast & Furious 8: The Fate of the Furious</i>. Yeah,
                    it's content by my own definition, it's truly not art, and
                    it's not about AI, and it's only loosely applicable here,
                    but it fucking slaps and you're my friend and I care about
                    you so I think you should watch it. It doesn't matter what's
                    under the hood; the only thing that matters is who's behind
                    the wheel. <i>Are you</i> behind the wheel?
