                <h1>I made a spreadsheet app in PICO-8!</h1>

                <p>
                    <a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php">PICO-8</a>
                    is a fantasy console from Lexaloffle — "fantasy" as in
                    there's not <i>actually</i> a box you can plug into your TV
                    (though you could certainly make one), but a system designed
                    with the contstraints that a console of a certain age might
                    actually have, like an 8-bit color pallette or 128x128-pixel
                    resolution. All of its devtools (a sprite/map editor,
                    sfx/music sequencer, coding interface) also exist within
                    those constraints, which is charming as hell. And in part,
                    it's the constraints that make it an excellent creative
                    tool, usually for small video games or music experiments.
                    Notably, <i>Celeste</i> started as a PICO-8 game, and
                    Adamatomic's <i>CorgiSpace</i>
                    <a
                        href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4044300/CorgiSpace/"
                        >just released on Steam</a
                    >.
                </p>

                <p>So naturally, I uh... I made a spreadsheet app with it:</p>

                <iframe
                    src="https://www.lexaloffle.com/bbs/widget.php?pid=pico_sheets"
                    allowfullscreen
                    width="621"
                    height="513"
                    style="border: none; overflow: hidden"
                ></iframe>

                <i
                    >(Press the X button to open the menu and load the "help"

                >

                <p>
                    I'll put together a video walking through the hows and whys
                    soon, but for now I think it's enough that it exists. It's
                    silly! I've got a little gameboy-shaped emulator that it
                    runs beautifully on.
                </p>

                <p>
                    And it proves a point that I'm keen to make as often as I
                    can:
                    <b
                        >practical digital tools like spreadsheets do not need
                        multi-million-dollar teams to be useful</b
                    >. If I can make a spreadsheet app that runs
                    <i>in PICO-8</i>, a system almost explicitly
                    <i>not</i> built for it, you can make the app you need with
                    what you've got access to. More on that soon!
