# RIP Glitch ðŸ’”

Nothing gold can stay. Today, [Glitch announced](https://blog.glitch.com/post/changes-are-coming-to-glitch/) they'll be shutting down hosting effective July 8th. 

I've been using Glitch to host my personal project for years now, and interactions with their staff will genuinely stick with me for years to come. Most of them resulted in new projects, like a brief Twitter collab with Anil Dash making a web version of [the phone from the _Dilemma_ music video](https://phone-from-dilemma.glitch.me/), or my most popular app [Next Slide Please](https://next-slide-please.glitch.me/) that was promoted on their homepage thanks to Jenn Turner, or a long series of shit-posts and pranks like [ASTL-E](https://astl-e.glitch.me/) inspired by Jenn Schiffer's community posts. 

Even more valuable to me, though, were conversations that happened behind the scenes; like advice from Jesse von Doom and Sue Smith that changed the course of my career at a pivotal moment. Or encouragement from Casey Kolderup and Keith Kurson to keep exploring even the silly ideas. 

When I took a leap and applied to my first software engineering job, I used my Glitch profile as a portfolio. In feedback I've received since, it genuinely helped me land the role I have now. And it did that, I think, by having more than a good product: they have good people steering the ship. Somehow, the talent Glitch attracted are among the smartest and kindest individuals I may ever know, and I'm so grateful for my small moments with them. If any of you are reading this: you're great, and I appreciate you so much. ðŸ’›

I'll be spending the next month deciding where to move all of my projects to, there are a few things like Next Slide and sheet-posting that I want to make sure stay running. I'll post updates here as I have them. In the meantime, let's all spend time following Glitch's example: find a way to empower your community, and do it genuinely. Be good to each other.
