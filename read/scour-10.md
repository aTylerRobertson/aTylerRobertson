# scour 1.0

_(This was originally posted to my Cohost account back in June, and I've only just remembered to share it here ðŸ˜…)_ 

A few months back I started putting together a site that wasn't a search engine, but also wasn't _not_ a search engine. It was purposefully designed to be small and manual and feel more like curating a playlist than becoming an all-knowing, all-dancing behemoth.

Today, I'm calling it [scour](https://scour.glitch.me/), and I've been steadily filling it with pages that I enjoy or search for frequently, so that it can start to become a replacement for much of my day-to-day searching activity, and maybe some of yours. _(Send me an email if there's a page I should add!)_

It's also gotâ€¦ not a lot of code in there! And the documentation includes steps to spin up your own version in 5 minutes or less, if you also like the sound of being your own local search provider.

I'm really proud of it so far, and I hope you enjoy!
