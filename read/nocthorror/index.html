                <h1>NoctHorror 2025!</h1>

                <p>
                    This weekend, my partner and I wrapped up the sixth annual
                    <i>NoctHorror</i> (formerly <i>OctHorror</i>, renamed
                    because it kept creeping further and further into November),
                    our annual Spooky Season film festival we do for our
                    friends. Normally, we watch 13 films over Zoom and wrap the
                    month with a pub quiz about those films, but this year I
                    went a little overboard and made the
                    <i>films themselves</i> into the puzzle. I kept all 13 films
                    a secret until 24 hours before each screening, and sent the
                    players puzzles along the way so they could try and suss
                    them out, as well as an overarching mystery. There's a lot
                    of internal lore that's built up over the last six years, so
                    sharing all of the clues won't make a ton of sense, but
                    check out this tube map I made for one of them:
                </p>

                <img alt="tube map" src="./Nocthorror_tube_map.svg" />

                <p>
                    The symbols on the left are part of the "ancient language
                    Dra-Q-Lese" spoken by long-time antagonist "Count Dra-Q-La",
                    and the map points the players both towards the next three
                    films in the series and hints at the broader theme of the
                    month, which culminated in drawing a giant pentagram on a
                    map to triangulate the Count's hideout. I was even
                    extra-devious this year and made some of the stops clickable
                    in the PDF, so savvy players could uncover hidden
                    mini-quizzes that netted them extra points in the finale.
                    I'm extremely proud of it, but <i>woof</i> am I tired. 😅
                    Part of this year's event was a symbolic "passing the
                    torch", and I'm excited for someone else to take the reins
                    next year, at least when it comes to picking the films.
                </p>

                <p>This year, we watched:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>A Quiet Place</li>
                    <li>Bodies Bodies Bodies</li>
                    <li>Poseidon</li>
                    <li>247℉</li>
                    <li>Let It Snow (2020)</li>
                    <li>Saloum</li>
                    <li>Anaconda</li>
                    <li>Bacurau</li>
                    <li>In the Shadows in the Mountains</li>
                    <li>The Edge of the Shadows</li>
                    <li>The Platform</li>
                    <li>Omen</li>
                    <li>Congo</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    And before you even start — I <i>know</i> that some of those
                    aren't horror films. I was going for a whole geographical
                    theme, it all made sense in the end.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Of the selection this year, I liked <i>Saloum</i> and
                    <i>Bacurau</i> the best (RIP Udo Kier), and despite
                    <i>Omen</i> being a straight-up drama (despite what the
                    trailer and marketing sell it as), I recommend that to
                    pretty much anybody.
                    <i>In the Shadows in the Mountains</i> and
                    <i>The Edge of the Shadows</i> aren't good movies by any
                    means (sorry, Malik), but it was so cool to see a Greenland
                    local's take on their folklore.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Because we started this tradition deep in the COVID-19
                    pandemic, all of our screenings were over Zoom, which is a
                    legally dark-gray area, but <b>hypothetically</b> one way to
                    facilitate this sort of thing is:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Buy as many of the films as possible on DVD</li>
                    <li>
                        Hook your DVD player into an HDMI switcher (so you can
                        swap between it and your Nintendo Switch and your Apple
                        TV)
                    </li>
                    <li>Make sure your</li>
                    <li>
                        Plug the output of the switcher into an HDMI splitter
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take one of the outputs from the splitter and plug it
                        into your TV
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take the other end of the splitter and plug it into an
                        HDMI-to-Analog converter (for example a
                        <i>Mini HDMI2AV Upscaler 1080p</i>, hypothetically)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Take an RCA cable from the output of the converter into
                        an Analog to USB Video Capture Device (there are a
                        hundred generic versions of these)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Optionally, use a USB to USB-C converter to plug that
                        into your laptop
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Use <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS Studio</a> to
                        take in the audio and video from the caputure device,
                        making sure to add any necessary filters to account for
                        "buzz" that might happen during the analog conversion
                    </li>
                    <li>Start the OBS virtual camera</li>
                    <li>Open Zoom or your video communication app of choice</li>
                    <li>
                        Set your camera and microphone to the OBS virtual camera
                        (and make sure to enable any "high-quality audio for
                        musicians" settings)
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    And <i>voila</i>! Hypothetically, you'll be watching your
                    favorite films with your friends, as though you were all in
                    the same room together. The digital-to-analog conversion
                    helps make sure DRM won't stop you, and gives everything an
                    actually pretty pleasant late-VHS/early-DVD vibe.
                </p>

                    In case you're looking for any further inspiration (or if
                    you're me next year, trying to remember this), here's what
                    we watched for previous NoctHorrors:

                    This year we had a "teen horror" theme, with everyone
                    picking cabins in the fictional "Camp Dra-Q-La" and
                    competing for prizes throughout the month. We watched:

                    run the quiz (I did, somehow, shove him out an airlock in

                    This was before we were officially doing themes, but even
                    then I was always playing with the idea of how each film
                    could relate to the next one, so the whole thing had kind of
                    a semi-logical flow to it.

                    This was when we landed on doing 13 films for the event,
                    which gave us a good (spooky) number and meant we could
                    schedule it in a way that fit for more of our friends'
                    schedules. As always, the real monster is "having other

                    We started this right in the middle of a lockdown, half out
                    of our minds anyway, and just needed to do <i>something</i>.
                    So we thought it would be a good idea to watch one movie
                    every night for the entire month of October (save for
                    Halloween, when we did the quiz). And it was a good idea at
                    the time! Just... not one I'd do again.
