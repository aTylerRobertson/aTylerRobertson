# RSS reader slowly becoming less experimental

I've been gently pushing changes to [my experimental RSS reader](https://tyler-rss.glitch.me/) over the last few months, and while it's still intentionally simple, I'm quite pleased with how useful it is.

Case in point: I can use multiple "super secret passphrase"s to group together feeds, each creating a page with custom CSS to set them apart. That's pretty neat.
