                Hey buddy, long time no see. I heard you're still using that
                hammer to drive nails — good choice, smart choice, gets the job
                done when you need it to. <i>Slow</i> though, yeah? Feels too
                slow. Wish it were faster. Right? Well hoo boy, hold onto your
                hat, because
            </p>
            <h1>I've got a hammer to sell you</h1>
            <p>
                The boys in the lab
                <i>(of course they're all boys, haha)</i> whipped up a new thing
                for us called <b>Hammer 2</b>, and it does exactly what you're
                looking for. See what happens is you use it just like any other
                hammer, right? Swing, hit the nail, nail goes in. Simple. But 1%
                of the time, <i>bam!</i> <b>Hammer 2</b> builds the whole rest
                of the house for you. Ain't that nice? I've invested three
                billion dollars into developing <b>Hammer 2</b>, I'll sell them
                to you for peanuts — how many you want?
            </p>
            <h2>Oh, I forgot to mention,</h2>
            <p>
                That 1% of the time
                <i
                    >(that's ah, a 1-in-100 chance every swing, not guaranteed
                    1-per-100, you see, but with investment we wanna get up to
                    2% next fiscal year!)</i
                >, when the incredible power of <b>Hammer 2</b> builds the house
                for you, the parts gotta come from somewhere, so we've ah,
                <i>"ethically sourced"</i> our materials from other houses in
                the neighborhood. Wallpaper, drywall, outlets, that sort of
                thing. No no, don't worry, it's just from your neighbors, nobody
                important. And of course because those parts come from all over,
                the end result won't always look like your blueprints. But
                that's part of the charm, right? I've invested sixteen billion
                American buckaroonies into <b>Hammer 2</b> — that's "billion"
                with a "b", you get me? — and I've got your competitors rounding
                the block for 'em. How many you want?
            </p>
            <h2>Good news, buddy,</h2>
            <p>
                The nerds in finance just told me that we made enough from the
                first round of <b>Hammer 2</b>
                <i>(thanks to your competitors, I should add)</i>, that we can
                give you a whole pile of 'em for <i>free</i>. Not forever,
                obviously, we'll check back in a month or two, but yeah go on
                you can take 'em now. That's free money for you! Now ah,
                obviously, we'll own the rights to whatever you make with
                <b>Hammer 2</b> during this trial period. Just business, you
                understand, you're a smart cookie. We <s>probably</s> won't do
                anything with it, it's just something the suits upstairs
                insisted on, since we're giving you the awe-inspiring power of
                <b>Hammer 2</b> for free and all. Have you seen our latest ad on
                the TV? "The power of the future," they're calling it, hell of a
                thing, that's why I'm investing 30bil in it this week. Thing of
                the future! How many you want?
            </p>
            <h2>Say what you want,</h2>
            <p>
                but <i><b>Hammer 2</b> is here to stay,</i> buddy! Everyone's
                saying it now — not just your competitors, but your aunts and
                uncles and cousins and everyone you knew in high school is
                <i>gaga</i> for <b>Hammer 2</b>. You got yours yet? Build any
                good houses lately? It'll build those for ya, you know, about 1%
                of the time. Sure, the other 99% is just as difficult, but the
                boys in the lab <i>(obviously they're boys, haha)</i> promise me
                we're gonna get to 2% real soon, and you don't wanna get left
                behind, do ya pal? I just put in another thirty B's into it, did
                you hear on the news? <b>Hammer 2</b> ain't going nowhere,
                that's what I always say. How many you want?
            </p>
            <h2>Don't get left behind, pal,</h2>
            <p>
                I just dropped another fifteen big ones into a new
                <b>Hammer 2</b> factory out east — no, haha, not one of the
                places you care about — and thanks to that we've added a feature
                to <b>Hammer 2</b> where it can <i>remove</i> nails, too! How
                about that, huh? Ever heard of a hammer that can do that? Didn't
                think so. <i>Sure</i>, yeah, what they said in the news is true,
                every nail driven by <b>Hammer 2</b> does carry a 1% risk of
                taking all the nails out of a random house near the factory, but
                it's not like anyone <i>you</i> know lives there! Who lives
                there, anyway? No one who's invested in <b>Hammer 2</b>, I'll
                tell you that much, otherwise they'd have at least
                <i>three</i> houses by now! Everyone who's anyone is using them
                now, did you see that tweebop the president just posted on
                bluzzit? Brand new capital building, just like that! Whole damn
                country's investing a hundred billion into <b>Hammer 2</b> next
                week to make sure the boys in blue
                <i>(obviously they're men, haha)</i> have bigger, bolder
                stations to keep them safe from whatever this <i>noise</i> I
                keep hearing about on the news is. The next state over's already
                sending us six billion from their own budget, asking for more
                <b>Hammer 2</b>. How many you want?
            </p>
            <h2>We're growing money on trees over here,</h2>
            <p>
                let me know when you're in town next, champ, I want to introduce
                you to our board of trustees. Yeah, six of the boys
                <i>(obviously they're boys, haha)</i>, my ride-or-dies from the
                last couple startups. Real great guys, only a couple of them are
                pedophiles I'm pretty sure. Great taste in cars! You like boats?
                We're having a party out on the <b>Hammer 2</b> mega yacht next
                week, would love to have you there if you can make it. Did you
                see the pleewips on scroodle I just posted of it? Hell yeah,
                bud! That's what I'm talking about! Couldn't have done any of
                this without <b>Hammer 2</b>. I swear, if you just figure out
                the <i>right</i> way to hit the nail, that 1% chance will come
                up for you <i>every time</i>, bro. That's the thing about these
                people complaining that it's "not working" for them, they just
                don't understand the fine art of <b>Hammer 2</b>! They've got
                <i>small minds</i>, bro! Nobody's losing their
                <i>job</i> because of <b>Hammer 2</b>, if anything it will
                <i>create</i> jobs for people who know how to finesse it! Smart
                people like <i>you</i>, buddy! That's why I wanted to turn you
                onto <b>Hammer 2</b> this whole time, it's because
                <i>people like us</i> are the future. <b>Hammer 2</b> is
                changing everything, pal, it's <i>here to stay</i>, and we're
                gonna ride it all the way to the top.
            </p>
            <p>So, uh, how many you want?</p>
            <h2>Slow down, buddy, what do you mean,</h2>
            <p>
                "Not up to code?" what are you talking about, "building codes"?
                What even is that? Oh, you think there are <i>rules</i> for
                making houses now? Since when? Get real, bud, the only rules are
                the ones you listen to, and <b>Hammer 2</b> <i>proves</i> that
                those rules should <i>only</i> be written by people like us.
                Because we get it! We <i>obviously</i> know how houses should be
                built, look at all this money we've invested in <b>Hammer 2</b>!
                Would idiots who don't know how to build houses do that? Don't
                make me laugh. If we were idiots who didn't know how to build
                houses, would we be putting in a <i>trillion</i> dollars to take
                <b>Hammer 2</b> to the next level this year? Yeah, you heard me,
                we're working on <b style="color: darkred">Hammer 3</b> already.
                <b style="color: darkred">Hammer 3</b>'s gonna build stuff you
                can't even <i>dream</i> about if you're not someone like us,
                pal. Only people with <i>vision</i> can get into what
                <b style="color: darkred">Hammer 3</b> will offer them, it's
                going to be off the scales. How many you want?
            </p>
            <h2>Last chance to act, pal!</h2>
            <p>
                OK buddy, this is the moment: we're real excited for the launch
                of <b style="color: darkred">Hammer 3</b>, and the boys in the
                lab <i>(obviously they're boys, haha)</i> are telling me that
                <b style="color: red">Hammer 4</b> is going to be literally
                <i>the shit</i>. We're talking <i>5%</i> odds, bud.
                <i>Yeah.</i> What we need from you now is a commitment. Because
                if you're not in, all the way, <i>right now</i>, we don't think
                you'll be able to keep up with where we're going. We need you to
                prove to us that you're committed to <b>Hammer 2</b>, you
                understand. We need <i>investment</i> from you. And if you're
                in, you're in! We'll make sure you're on the ground floor of all
                the new possibilities we build together with, who knows, maybe
                even <b style="color: blue">Hammer 5</b>? We're building a
                better <i>world</i>, bro, but it's all gotta start here. The
                prices for <b>Hammer 2</b> are going up, so you can really prove
                you're <i>in</i>, that you're like <i>us</i>, by getting some
                now. I promise it's worth it. I promise.
            </p>
