<h1>Well, well, well...</h1>

<p>Look who said they wouldn't roll their own blog and RSS, and here they are anyway!</p>

<p>This is all super basic, feel free to check out the <a href="https://github.com/aTylerRobertson/aTylerRobertson">source code</a> in the usual place. I'll be using it mostly for unserious writing, don't expect big tech guides or anything. <i>(that's coming in the book 👀)</i></p>

<h1>What do you do with a fascist spreadsheet?</h1>

<p>Well, I guess they're evil now. 404 Media <i>(go support independent journalism)</i> <a href="https://www.404media.co/google-has-chosen-a-side-in-trumps-mass-deportation-effort/">has a report up now</a> about how Google is hosting an app designed to help ICE "identify immigrants", which is... pretty fascist behavior. Meanwhile, Microsoft seems pretty chill about them <a href="https://www.avclub.com/microsoft-mum-ice-trump-halo-imagery">using Halo as a recruitment ad</a>, and the <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-employees-protest-stop-work-with-ice-over-cruel-border-policies/">long-standing contract ICE has with GitHub</a>. Does this mean that using Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel, or even hosting my site on GitHub Pages like I do right now are acts in support of fascism? </p>

<p>I mean... probably not directly, right? But it's something to consider, especially now that I'm thinking about moving back into the world of writing about these kinds of tools. It's not going to be enough to use a tool from a fascist company in a non-fascist way (the medium is the message, etc.), so the work itself has to be anti-fascist from end to end. <i>Antifasheets</i>, if you will. </p>

<p>I don't know what that looks like yet. Is <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org">LibreOffice</a> any good? Do I roll my own thing, like I'm doing <a href="/">on my homepage</a>? Suggestions welcome. </p>

<h1>Disorganized thoughts of the week - Friday, November 21</h1>

<p>After all that work to get the new blog set up, I nearly forgot I had it! Haven't had the energy to put together a full post on anything this week, so here's a collection of thoughts from the week that I want to talk about and might put more words to soon.</p>

<h2><a href="#Brand vs. Hobby">Brand vs. Hobby</a></h2>

<p>I've been thinking about my <a href="../what-do-you-do-with-a-fascist-spreadsheet/">previous post</a> and can't shake the harm that branding — as a concept — has done to tech. It's never enough for something to be "just a bit of code", it has to have a clever name and logo to associate it with, or else people won't take it seriously. That's "hobby code". And then when there <i>is</i> a brand name to go along with it, your Googles and Microsofts of the world, it's trusted implicitly, even when it shouldn't be. I'm sure this isn't a new problem, but it does feel pretty related to recent events, especially thinking about how various AI products now all have catchy, human-sounding names. They're all <i>just code</i>, but the brand plays a powerful part in how people interact with them. </p>

<p>Going back to the spreadsheet of it all, I do feel like the next thing I want to focus on is something more <i>conceptually complete</i> than <i>marketable</i>, maybe extending something like this <a href="../bookmarklet-spreadsheet/">bookmarklet spreadsheet</a> so the tool can exist on its own and separate from any one brand or person. </p>
                
<h2><a href="#Software Engineering is a Sales job">Software Engineering is a Sales job</a></h2>

<p>Related to the whole branding thought is that I've just had an interview for a senior role at my company, and feel like more and more the job of a software engineer is more about sales than coding ability. For example, you have to know which Amazon product best suits a given scenario, and how to adjust your AWS usage to fit a budget. Or you have to explain your AI prompt process, and why you prefer Claude over Copilot. And then if you're lucky there's a <i>tiny</i> bit of coding for you to do, but you have to make sure you're following the standards that Meta gave a cute brand name to. </p>

<p>Which is all... <i>fine</i>, I guess, but we can't do that <i>and</i> tell people just starting in the industry that it's a career full of puzzle solving and critical thinking. (Though now that I've said that I'm sure that illusion will die the second any of them meet a manager.) </p>

<h2><a href="#Trans Day of Remembrance">Trans Day of Remembrance</a></h2>

<p>Trans Day of Remembrance was yesterday, and like always I nearly forget until about 10pm. I'm glad it exists, but I wish everyone did more to make it so trans people are known and cared for while still living. </p>

<h2><a href="#NoctHorror 2026">NoctHorror 2026</a></h2>

<p>We're wrapping up our annual Halloween movie festival! (It used to be called <i>OctHorror</i> but we've been creeping further and further into November) I'll do a full write-up of it next month, but I've been very happy with my video setup this year, which involves an HDMI-to-analog converter that I <i>highly</i> recommend to anyone who streams and likes that SD video look. Our screenings had the vibe of watching VHS tapes with friends, and I had a load of fun making it all work.</p>

<p>The big difference this year was that I kept the films a secret until the day before each screening, but would send puzzles with hints towards the film and their order. So before each film they could guess what the upcoming films would be, and get more points based on how far ahead they could accurately guess. A few people did really well! Some of the clues are very dependent on inside jokes so I'll only share some in the full write-up, but the morale of the story is that we should all be making puzzles for our friends. </p>

<item><title>NoctHorror 2025!</title><link>https://aTylerRobertson.com/read/nocthorror</link><description><![CDATA[
<h1>NoctHorror 2025!</h1>

<p>This weekend, my partner and I wrapped up the sixth annual <i>NoctHorror</i> (formerly <i>OctHorror</i>, renamed because it kept creeping further and further into November), our annual Spooky Season film festival we do for our friends. Normally, we watch 13 films over Zoom and wrap the month with a pub quiz about those films, but this year I went a little overboard and made the <i>films themselves</i> into the puzzle. I kept all 13 films a secret until 24 hours before each screening, and sent the players puzzles along the way so they could try and suss them out, as well as an overarching mystery. There's a lot of internal lore that's built up over the last six years, so sharing all of the clues won't make a ton of sense, but check out this tube map I made for one of them:</p>

<img alt="tube map" src="images/Nocthorror<i>tube</i>map.svg" />

<p>The symbols on the left are part of the "ancient language Dra-Q-Lese" spoken by long-time antagonist "Count Dra-Q-La", and the map points the players both towards the next three films in the series and hints at the broader theme of the month, which culminated in drawing a giant pentagram on a map to triangulate the Count's hideout. I was even extra-devious this year and made some of the stops clickable in the PDF, so savvy players could uncover hidden mini-quizzes that netted them extra points in the finale. I'm extremely proud of it, but <i>woof</i> am I tired. 😅 Part of this year's event was a symbolic "passing the torch", and I'm excited for someone else to take the reins next year, at least when it comes to picking the films.</p>

<p>This year, we watched:</p>

<ol>
<li>A Quiet Place</li>
<li>Bodies Bodies Bodies</li>
<li>Poseidon</li>
<li>247℉</li>
<li>Let It Snow (2020)</li>
<li>Saloum</li>
<li>Anaconda</li>
<li>Bacurau</li>
<li>In the Shadows in the Mountains</li>
<li>The Edge of the Shadows</li>
<li>The Platform</li>
<li>Omen</li>
<li>Congo</li>
</ol>

<p>And before you even start — I <i>know</i> that some of those aren't horror films. I was going for a whole geographical theme, it all made sense in the end.</p>

<p>Of the selection this year, I liked <i>Saloum</i> and <i>Bacurau</i> the best (RIP Udo Kier), and despite <i>Omen</i> being a straight-up drama (despite what the trailer and marketing sell it as), I recommend that to pretty much anybody. <i>In the Shadows in the Mountains</i> and <i>The Edge of the Shadows</i> aren't good movies by any means (sorry, Malik), but it was so cool to see a Greenland local's take on their folklore.</p>

<p>Because we started this tradition deep in the COVID-19 pandemic, all of our screenings were over Zoom, which is a legally dark-gray area, but <b>hypothetically</b> one way to facilitate this sort of thing is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Buy as many of the films as possible on DVD</li>
<li>Hook your DVD player into an HDMI switcher (so you can swap between it and your Nintendo Switch and your Apple TV)</li>
<li>Make sure your 
<li>Plug the output of the switcher into an HDMI splitter</li>
<li>Take one of the outputs from the splitter and plug it into your TV</li>
<li>Take the other end of the splitter and plug it into an HDMI-to-Analog converter (for example a <i>Mini HDMI2AV Upscaler 1080p</i>, hypothetically)</li>
<li>Take an RCA cable from the output of the converter into an Analog to USB Video Capture Device (there are a hundred generic versions of these)</li>
<li>Optionally, use a USB to USB-C converter to plug that into your laptop</li>
<li>Use <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS Studio</a> to take in the audio and video from the caputure device, making sure to add any necessary filters to account for "buzz" that might happen during the analog conversion</li>
<li>Start the OBS virtual camera</li>
<li>Open Zoom or your video communication app of choice</li>
<li>Set your camera and microphone to the OBS virtual camera (and make sure to enable any "high-quality audio for musicians" settings)</li>
</ul>

<p>And <i>voila</i>! Hypothetically, you'll be watching your favorite films with your friends, as though you were all in the same room together. The digital-to-analog conversion helps make sure DRM won't stop you, and gives everything an actually pretty pleasant late-VHS/early-DVD vibe.</p>

<p>In case you're looking for any further inspiration (or if you're me next year, trying to remember this), here's what we watched for previous NoctHorrors:</p>

<h2><a href="#2024">2024</a></h2>

<p>This year we had a "teen horror" theme, with everyone picking cabins in the fictional "Camp Dra-Q-La" and competing for prizes throughout the month. We watched:</p>

<ol>
<li>Jennifer's Body</li>
<li>Ginger Snaps</li>
<li>I Know What You Did Last Summer</li>
<li>Final Destination</li>
<li>Fright Night (1985)</li>
<li>House of Wax (2005)</li>
<li>The Lost Boys</li>
<li>Chopping Mall</li>
<li>Jeepers Creepers</li>
<li>The Funhouse</li>
<li>Happy Death Day</li>
<li>Sleepaway Camp</li>
<li>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</li>
</ol>

<h2><a href="#2023">2023</a></h2>

<p>This was our first themed year where we voted for "space", so naturally I included a fully-voiced HAL 9000 to "help" me run the quiz (I did, somehow, shove him out an airlock in the end).</p>

<ol>
<li>The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951)</li>
<li>Killer Klowns from Outer Space</li>
<li>Plan 9 from Outer Space</li>
<li>The Thing</li>
<li>Jason X</li>
<li>Leprechaun 4</li>
<li>Hellraiser IV: Bloodline</li>
<li>Planet of the Vampires</li>
<li>Solaris (1972)</li>
<li>Event Horizon</li>
<li>Sunshine</li>
<li>Predator</li>
<li>Alien</li>
</ol>

<h2><a href="#2022">2022</a></h2>

<p>This was before we were officially doing themes, but even then I was always playing with the idea of how each film could relate to the next one, so the whole thing had kind of a semi-logical flow to it.</p>

<ol>
<li>Dracula</li>
<li>The Wolf Man</li>
<li>Monster House</li>
<li>The Cabin in the Woods</li>
<li>The Evil Dead</li>
<li>Drag Me To Hell</li>
<li>Friday the 13th (2009)</li>
<li>Halloween 3: Season of the Witch</li>
<li>Old</li>
<li>Us</li>
<li>Parasite</li>
<li>Pet Sematary (2019)</li>
<li>Shaun of the Dead</li>
</ol>

<h2><a href="#2021">2021</a></h2>

<p>This was when we landed on doing 13 films for the event, which gave us a good (spooky) number and meant we could schedule it in a way that fit for more of our friends' schedules. As always, the real monster is "having other responsibilities"!</p>

<ol>
<li>The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</li>
<li>Psycho</li>
<li>The Birds</li>
<li>Rosemary's Baby</li>
<li>Don't Look Now</li>
<li>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</li>
<li>Halloween II</li>
<li>Bloodbath at the House of Death</li>
<li>Silence of the Lambs</li>
<li>Candyman (1992)</li>
<li>Mary Shelley's Frankenstein</li>
<li>It Follows</li>
<li>One Cut of the Dead</li>
</ol>

<h2><a href="#2020">2020</a></h2>

<p>We started this right in the middle of a lockdown, half out of our minds anyway, and just needed to do <i>something</i>. So we thought it would be a good idea to watch one movie every night for the entire month of October. And it was a good idea at the time! Just... not one I'd do again.</p>

<ol>
<li>Hocus Pocus</li>
<li>The Addams Family</li>
<li>Sleepy Hollow</li>
<li>Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street</li>
<li>Corpse Bride</li>
<li>The Craft</li>

<item><title>A spreadsheet is a war of attrition</title><link>https://aTylerRobertson.com/read/a-spreadsheet-is-a-war-of-attrition</link><description><![CDATA[
<h1>A spreadsheet is a war of attrition</h1>

<p>Something I'll start writing about more here — so that you'll keep me accountable, if nothing else — is that I'm starting to write a book.</p>

<p>Specifically, I'm starting to write a book about spreadsheets, and what they are, and what they can do. I've been trying to isolate what specifically I'm drawn to in this subject, and just now my partner pulled up <a href="https://royaldrawingschool.org/events/drawing-dialogues-with-sir-grayson-perry-ra">this talk</a> with Sir Grayson Perry. When talking about his process, he said (paraphrasing), "I'm not one of these artists who comes in with an effortless line. My art is more like a <b>war of attrition</b>." In Perry's art, that lust for war comes from his love of outsider art, and building up a piece of art through painstaking little steps of process and craft, rather than effortlessly falling into something. And this will sound crazy, but:</p>

<b>Spreadsheets are a war of attrition.</b>

<p>When I was making video games in spreadsheets, using only built-in functions, it wasn't intended to be a showcase of my own technical mastery; kind of the opposite, actually. What I <i>wanted</i> to do (best laid plans and all that) was show what could be built up from a modest and boring starting place if you pour enough time and careful thought into it. It was a million tiny knife strokes in code instead of paint, unobscured by the final piece.</p>

<p>That last part is just as important to me: when you as the user want to learn how a "good" spreadsheet works, those answers are there for you in the piece itself. That makes it a unique artform from apps or AI slop or any of the million bits of corporate code we interact with now, which hide their true forms away from you like that Simpsons meme where Homer's pinned all his fat back with chip clips and hair ties. We can't learn anything from those, because they resist being learned. But a spreadsheet bares its scars in the open for you, and there's something poetic and lovely about that that I want to share with you.</p>

<p>Anyway, so that's what the book's about. Stay tuned.</p>
