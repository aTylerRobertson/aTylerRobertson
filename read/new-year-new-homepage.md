# New year, new homepage

Well, I say "new year" but it's mid-February... no, I'll allow it.

I've got a new home page, [check it out](https://atylerrobertson.com)! It's inspired by [Popular Mechanics](https://archive.org/details/popularmechanics0000unse_f7g2/page/n3/mode/2up) guidebooks, one of my favorite things to spend hours on as a kid (which... explains a lot).

For fans of the old page, never fear! I've saved it [over yonder](https://aTylerRobertson.com/use/sheet), and will work on some improvements down the road.
