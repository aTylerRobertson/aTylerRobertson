## Blooming flowers in Google Sheets ðŸŒ¼

I've been thinking a lot about the _point_ of my hobbies. We've reached a point where, unless a hobby can be actively monetized, or unless you're quantifiably the best in the world at it, many hobbies feel pointless. Maybe not even worth pursuing. But, there are lots of things that I'm interested in, specifically because I _want_ them to be pointless. For example, my Google Sheets obsession over the last year+; besides a few funny articles for work, I don't really _want_ to turn that into something that I make money from. I just want to have fun doing it. 

Is that okay? I haven't seen a lot of examples of _just doing things for fun_ lately. Maybe that's just where we're at in the world (which makes sense, given... _everything_), or maybe I'm just not rolling in the right circles anymore. 

Ron Miller's _Advanced Improv Practice Guide_ and this [customizable remix of it](https://practice-guide.glitch.me/) mention that the purpose of practicing an art shouldn't be to make a profit, or to become famous. Instead, it should be to "contribute to the world's spiritual growth." I like that, and I hope that in some small way, maybe I can do that with silly spreadsheets at some point. 

To that end, I made something for you:

[Here's a spreadsheet where, instead of a progress bar, a flower blooms ðŸŒ¼](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19tOu1iZyRBb5qjH6b0eJCu7Mn2y3Jtmki82FT1pyv0w/copy)

It works with any percentage number between 0 and 100 (it can go beyond, but that looks silly), and a flower slowly blooms as you reach the end. 

Each flower is in a single formula, using the [sparkline](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/3093289) function to draw a simple [BÃ©zier curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve) as the stem, and a growing [rhodonea curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rose_(mathematics)) as the petals. Enjoy!
