# Watch my talk from Roguelike Celebration 2022!

I was *so* thrilled to speak at Roguelike Celebration this year -- an event I'd watched from a distance for years, but never felt like I could "fit in" until recently. The staff was amazing to work with, and the audience was so friendly and welcoming. Turns out there was a much bigger overlap between spreadsheets and roguelikes than I expected!
