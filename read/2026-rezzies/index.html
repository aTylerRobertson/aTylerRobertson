            <article> <h1>Announcing the 2026 Rezzies</h1>

<i>(I heard Producer Ben on</i> Blank Check with Griffin and David <i>say "rezzies" instead of "resolutions" and it stuck in my brain like a Kennedian worm, so here we are.)</i>

<p>New Year's Resolutions! They're a real crapshoot for me if we're being honest, and I've tried a half-dozen pretty jerk-off-motion ways of calling them by other names over the years. Big fan of the <a href="https://www.themesystem.com">Theme System</a> idea of having yearly <i>themes</i> instead of explicit resolutions, but I could never make that stick personally. I've also done yearly <i>recaps</i> instead to see if I felt better about annual retrospectives than look-aheads (I don't). But here I am back to plain old resolutions, declaring to the world that these are things I <i>want</i> to do in the next year, and releasing myself from any judgment if I don't get around to all of them for whatever reason. Hopefully, I think, putting some of this down in writing will spur me into action six, seven months from now when I've lost motivation again.</p>

<h2><a href="#Writing">Writing</a></h2>

<p>I've started working on a book! I'm a couple thousand words in and have an outline I feel good about already, but this coming year I want to set aside dedicated writing time to finish it up. </p>

<h2><a href="#Music">Music</a></h2>

<p>I used to play music, and don't so much anymore, but would like to again! This will require a bit of change in my home setup, as there's not really a place to play without disturbing neighbors, but hopefully with some good headphones I can make this happen.</p>

<h2><a href="#Sport">Sport</a></h2>

<p>I've started working out again recently, and want to get into a sport next year. Specifically, I'm really itching to lift/throw heavy things? </p>

<h2><a href="#Styling">Styling</a></h2>

<p>I feel strongly that Spring should come with a bit of a wardrobe shake-up for me, specifically leaning into more femme fashions and pieces that make me feel actually <i>sexy</i> over just <i>presentable</i>. Some skirts, some low-cut shirts, and showing off my arms and legs more will hopefully be in the cards soon. </p>

<p>2026 is also the year I want to start experimenting with makeup! I know myself well enough to know I won't like wearing <i>lots</i> of it, but there's little things I want to experiment with to shake up my daily look. </p>

<h2><a href="#Drag">Drag</a></h2>

<p>Related to the above, I really want to try performing in drag this year! I think I'd enjoy it, and I think I'd be good at it!</p>

<h2><a href="#Community">Community</a></h2>

<p>While I'm so glad that I've found queer people at work that I can spend small amounts of time with, those interactions are very much limited to the office, and I don't really have a community in London that I can share life events with yet. I want to change this, get some out-of-office friends in my area, and feel like I have a support network physically nearby (even though my remote support group is the best and I love you all, you're just an ocean a way is all). I'm in my 30s so I'm (as is my millennial birthright) not sure how to do this at all. I know a couple people who know a couple people involved in the local drag scene, so I'm wondering if that's secretly my way into checking off a few of these things at once. </p>

<h2><a href="#Huge birthday party">Huge birthday party</a></h2>

<p>My birthday is in June (every year!) and for my 35th I want to throw a big, fuck-off birthday party with a theme and costumes and prizes and merch and everything. I've already started drawing up some plans, and I'm about to start roping friends into contributing. </p>

<p>And I think that'll be my year! Fingers crossed I get at least a few of these things done. </p>             </article>
