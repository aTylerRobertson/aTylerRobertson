                        Hi! I'm <a href="#">Tyler</a>, I'm a non-binary
                        (they/them) person originally from Sacramento-ish,
                        California, and lately based in London, England. I have
                        over a decade and a half of experience
                        <b
                            >helping the average person understand the digital
                            tools at their disposal</b
                        >. That's looked like working as a tutor, adjunct
                        professor, customer support agent, developer relations,
                        event production manager, software engineer, and more —
                        none of those are in the order you think they're in —
                        and some of you may be saying already that most of those
                        don't sound like jobs where I'd be doing a lot of
                        education about tech, but the joke would be on you!
                        <i>Everyone needs to understand their technology.</i>

                    <p>
                        I was radicalized (is that the right word?) to that idea
                        early on, and in a couple different ways: first, because
                        I was homeschooled as a kid, my dad thought it would be
                        a good idea to have me learn HTML and CSS. That came in
                        <i>super handy</i> when MySpace launched and suddenly
                        all of my friends needed help building out their home
                        pages with auto-playing music and sparkling Top-8s. One
                        day a friend of mine said, "Wouldn't it be cool if we
                        had our <i>own</i> MySpace?" So I went to my dad and
                        asked how to do that; he handed me books on PHP and
                        MySQL, and after a couple weeks of homeschooler
                        hyperfocus I had a fully fleshed out social network for
                        my friends. Now, luckily I didn't think to save any
                        screenshots because I'm sure everything we posted was
                        just layers of cringe, but overwhelmingly I thought
                        <i
                            >"Wow, <b>people can just do this</b>. Why doesn't
                            everyone do this?"</i
                        >
                    </p>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>
                        When I was early on in learning about computers, I was
                        gifted one of those netbooks for kids — you know, the
                        ones they made before everyone had an ipad in class —
                        that ran a bespoke, "simplified" Linux OS. I didn't know
                        anything about Linux, so I trial-and-errored my way
                        through things like running Minecraft or setting up
                        email, but at some point I needed a bit of software
                        installed via the terminal, and I couldn't figure out
                        how to do it. There weren't any instruction manuals with
                        the OS, and even typing "help" into the command line
                        returned loads of unrelated topics. I turned to the
                        internet and everything I found pointed back to the same
                        guide, which said:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <i
                            >To install a program on your Linux machine, simply:

                                    Locate the URL of the program you want to
                                    install
                                </li>

                                    device
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </i>

                    <p>
                        Imagine little 13-year-old me <i>screaming</i> at the
                        website, <i>"But what <b>is</b> that???"</i> (turns out
                        it was <code>yum install</code> if you're curious) And
                        ever since, any time I find an unhelpful document or an
                        "Explain it like I'm 5" video that uses too many big
                        words, I'm transported back to that moment. And this
                        happens a lot! There is a thing we see in tech over and
                        over again which is that people (let's be honest: tech
                        bros) think they need to look smart, and the best way to
                        do that is to confuse everyone around them. These guys
                        think that if no one can understand them, people will
                        just trust that they're some kind of unknowable genius.
                        Unfortunately, a lot of the time they're right (look at
                        certain electric car CEOs), but that doesn't mean that
                        all of us have to fall for their tricks.
                        <b>There are better ways.</b>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        And that brings us to now, some twenty-odd years later,
                        still working to make the things that should be
                        simple... simple.

                        And, yeah, it is, but consider: when you plug your phone
                        in at night, it probably checks for software updates.
                        Who makes that software? Do you? What's to stop the
                        people who <i>do</i> make the software from making the
                        nightly update... permanently disable your device? If
                        you paid for the device outright, or pay monthly through
                        your cell plan, they have no direct contract with you
                        that prevents them from doing that. And given that the
                        most powerful owners of the biggest companies are
                        cozying up to increasingly fascist government leaders,
                        they could do so without any repercussions that matter.
