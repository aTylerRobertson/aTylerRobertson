                    Am I doing
                    <input id="thing" placeholder="anything" />
                    right?
                </h2>

                <h1>NO.</h1>

                <p>
                    No one knows the "right" way to do
                    <span class="fill-in">anything</span>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anyone who thinks they're doing
                    <span class="fill-in">anything</span> the right way is
                    basing that on ideas that somebody else came up with—and
                    that person had no clue how to do
                    <span class="fill-in">anything</span> when they started, and
                    just made stuff up.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you're doing <span class="fill-in">anything</span>, the
                    more important question is,
                    <i>"Am I <b>enjoying</b> it?"</i>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because if the answer is "yes", and you're not hurting
                    anybody, then you're already leading a much more fulfilling
                    life than the people who claim to hold the secret to
                    <span class="fill-in">anything</span>, because you're doing
                    it the right way for you. And that's what actually matters.
